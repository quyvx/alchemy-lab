## Imbalance learning
### Credit card fraud detection
- Used PCA to identify important predictors. 
- My first machine learning project at City University. 
- As the main goal was to to understand more about the data, I selected logistic regression and decision tree. Obiviously could get better performance with more sophisticated models.
- Earned me a final interview at GoldmanSachs

### Sentiment classification of Amazon Reviews with PySpark
- Used Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes to classify 4 millions Amazon Reviews.
- Set up a PySpark pipeline to process data.
- TF-IDF gave similar result to word2vec, but took less time to run.
